Pilling 1871 & addenda (citing an 1815 edition, title obtained from Sabin). Sabin 33754: “Every class of Mexican or Aztec, and Peruvian Antiquities receives in this work the clearest philosophical analysis. Many of the plates are beautifully colored; indeed, it is the most beautiful and generally interesting of Humboldt’s works.” This work, the first major one to result from Humboldt’s American explorations, fell like a thunderbolt on the European intellectual, scientific, artistic, and political communities. Just as Columbus had returned from his own voyage with wonderful things to relate, so had Humboldt, whose coffers were so full of treasures that it required the rest of his life for him to display their contents to the astounded world. Departing Europe in 1799, Humboldt and his partner, Bonpland, caused a sensation merely by returning to Europe six years later, since they had widely been given up for dead. The voyage took place almost by accident as it commenced only because Humboldt was repeatedly frustrated in his attempts to explore elsewhere. While in Spain, after a series of fortunate events and crucial introductions, he was issued a rare passport and recommendation by Carlos IV for Spain’s overseas possessions and, thus, for the first time could indulge his passion for travel and exploration. Humboldt achieved cultural hero status in the United States and Mexico in the second half of the nineteenth century. His travels, experiments, and knowledge transformed Western science. Two more energetic, inquisitive, learned, and gifted explorers than Humboldt and Bonpland would be difficult to find, although in an historic coincidence, their U.S. counterparts, Lewis and Clark, would also be making an equivalent impact at the same time. Humboldt and Bonpland travelled extensively in South and Central America. They paid particular attention to the region’s plant life, geology, antiquities, minerals, and geography. The pair seems to have been especially fascinated by volcanoes, exploring and climbing several during their travels. The fascination the geological features held for the two is clearly indicated by the magnificent folded plate showing the great volcano of Chimborazo in the Andean highlands, probably the finest and most arresting scene in the entire volume, and a production exhibiting an American scene that would remain practically without rival until the works of Nebel and Gualdi later in the century. Chimborazo was long thought to be the highest mountain on earth (measured from sea level), and many attempts were made to ascend it in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In 1802 Humboldt and his party attempted to reach the summit and reached a point of 5,875 meters, higher than previously attained by any European up to that time. Humboldt referred to this event as one of the greatest moments of his life. Reports of this mountaineering accomplishment made Humboldt a celebrity in Europe. Humboldt included in this volume the first extensive reproductions of codices dating from around the Columbian era, such as materials from the Dresden Codex (the first publication), Codex Mendoza, and others. These plates inspired a renewed interest in American indigenous antiquities and were without rival until Kingsborough’s larger, more elaborate work nearly thirty years later (see herein). The production of this atlas was overseen closely by Humboldt, from the smallest details to the overall series. Many of the aquatint plates were based on his own drawings. He personally supervised the coloring to ensure that it was accurate. The work was published mostly at his own expense. Humboldt’s technique is sophisticated, sympathetic, and erudite, seeking as it does to place objects in both their human and natural context rather than as disembodied pieces of cultural fragmentation. Humboldt’s stated goal was “to examine the interweaving and interacting of all forces of nature.” He also was an early advocate of human rights and a pioneer in the field of ecology (see Aaron Sachs, “The Ultimate ‘Other’: Post-Colonialism and Alexander von Humboldt’s Ecological Relationship with Nature” in History and Theory 42:4, pp. 111–135). Humboldt’s subjects received the clearest philosophical analysis, and in its widest concept, this intellectual point of view stretched back to Diderot, Alambert, and their fellow encylopédistes.\""

This copy includes both the Arx Carolina plate and the Virginia pars Australis map, tipped in later. The work is an English translation of Arnold Montanus “De Nieuwe en Onbekende Weereld,” but with a number of additions concerning New England, New France, Maryland and Virginia. Many new maps and views were added. The Moxon map of Carolina is the first large format map of the newly established colony of Carolina. “America” was Ogilby’s finest foreign work; over 150 authors are credited although Montanus is lacking. “When it came to North America, particularly, he abandoned Montanus entirely for his own closer sources. His work used superior type and larger and finer paper than Montanus. Clearly some form of at least tacit agreement existed between Montanus and Ogilby as he acquired the same plates to illustrate his work. This is itself unusual as Ogilby was renowned for providing his own ‘sculptures’. The reasons may lie in the fact that the project clearly was already an expensive one, and that the work had been promised for some time and further delay was undesirable. The first map in the book, of the whole of America, was one of five plates provided by Ogilby himself. We may speculate that this was because Montanus did not actually own the Schagen plate, or that Ogilby wished to insert more English nomenclature” (Burden). Regarding Ogilby himself, he had a series of remarkably successful careers as a dancer, dance master, theatre manager/director, and translator of classics, and finally as author and publisher of travel and geography books."

Queretaro was a key link between the mining areas to the north of Mexico City and the port of Veracruz. Its location made it one of the most developed and affluent urban centers in eighteenth-century Spanish America. This very early example of urban mapping was originally issued with a set of urban ordinances, demonstrating the reforming intentions of its author - the city’s magistrate - at the pinnacle of the city’s Baroque age. The map depicts each of the city’s 155 blocks. It reveals intimate details of the city’s topography, including the aqueduct, individual buildings, monuments, workshops, fountains, and the network of roads that united the urban structure.\" (Note taken from the John Carter Brown Library record; see link in Pub Reference.)"

                  "value": "\"A Pair of Scarce Works on Isthmian Communication - With Many Maps The present volume contains two rare works relating to inter-oceanic communication through Central America. Both books are in French, issued at a pivotal moment in the conceptualization of an interoceanic canal through the Isthmus of Darien, now known as the Isthmus of Panama. The first title, by Felix Belly, includes three folding lithograph maps by A. Thomé de Gamond. Two of the maps relate to Central America, the other being a world map which indicates a profusion of maritime trade routes between Europe and America: Carte de l'Amerique Centrale comprenant les cinq Republiques de Guatemala, San-Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, et Costa-Rica... par Mr. A. Thomé de Gamond. Carte indiquant le tracé du Canal de Nicaragua conformément au traité Belly. Carte du Monde Indiquant l'abréviation des Routes maritimes par les Coupures de Suez et de Nicaragua... Central American Utopia: a Panama Canal Fantasy The second work, by Athanase Airiau, published in Paris in 1860, presents a visionary perspective on canalization and colonization in Panama. The work comprises five chapters and includes detailed maps and plans, aiming to support the feasibility and benefits of constructing an interoceanic canal to shorten sea journeys between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans more than 50 years before the eventual completion of the Panama Canal in 1914. The maps are noteworthy for their somewhat fantastical, fractal-like urban geography, bringing to mind similar geometrically complex colonial plans from previous centuries, such as Sir Robert Montgomery's 1717 plan for the Margravate of Azilia. Airiau aimed his proposal at the authorities of the Granadine Confederation, present-day Colombia. His vision was centered around the canalization and colonization of the Isthmus of Panama. Airiau's ambitious plan included founding 150 farms and a city to be populated by European settlers, who would engage in agricultural activities as well as contribute to the construction and maintenance of the proposed canal. The project envisioned by Airiau was not merely an infrastructural endeavor but also a utopian plan for colonization, featuring pre-defined sections for diverse crops such as vanilla, nopal, indigo, tobacco, cereals, cocoa, cotton, vineyards, sugar, sorghum, fruits, and vegetables, along with various types of livestock. Many of the maps here are dedicated to notable political figures of the time, including Pedro Alcántara Herrán and Mariano Ospina Pérez. Airiau published this work during a period of significant interest in and debate over the potential construction of a canal that would connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and thereby revolutionize global trade routes and maritime navigation. The text underscores the urgency of establishing such a canal, as recognized by the European community, reflecting the geopolitical and economic ambitions of the time. Airiau's advocacy for the Darien route over others is grounded in a comprehensive analysis of the region's geography, climate, and natural resources, positing it as the most favorable location for the canal's construction and for the establishment of a European colony. The narrative elaborates on the envisioned benefits of this dual project, which includes the creation of a maritime and commercial city, envisaging the canal not only as a feat of engineering but also as a catalyst for agricultural and industrial colonization. The city plans are notable, both for showing important urban characteristics and for their unusual shape. The Industrial City has quays and neighborhoods split between France, Russia, Great Britain, Austria, Spain, the Netherlands, Prussia, and the United States. The Agricultural City has roads the zig and zag without any particular purpose beyond top-down aesthetics, with some roads changing course in the middle of open fields where a straight line would have sufficed. Had they ever been completed the cities would have been something to behold, post-Hausmann grand European urban architecture carved out of the jungles of Central America. Despite the innovative nature of Airiau's proposal, it did not come to fruition, a reality attributable to its utopian character. Nonetheless, this historical episode illustrates the early and ambitious endeavors to improve global maritime routes in the Panama region decades before the successful completion of the Panama Canal in the 20th century.

                  "value": "\"A Pair of Scarce Works on Isthmian Communication - With Many Maps The present volume contains two rare works relating to inter-oceanic communication through Central America. Both books are in French, issued at a pivotal moment in the conceptualization of an interoceanic canal through the Isthmus of Darien, now known as the Isthmus of Panama. The first title, by Felix Belly, includes three folding lithograph maps by A. Thomé de Gamond. Two of the maps relate to Central America, the other being a world map which indicates a profusion of maritime trade routes between Europe and America: Carte de l'Amerique Centrale comprenant les cinq Republiques de Guatemala, San-Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, et Costa-Rica... par Mr. A. Thomé de Gamond. Carte indiquant le tracé du Canal de Nicaragua conformément au traité Belly. Carte du Monde Indiquant l'abréviation des Routes maritimes par les Coupures de Suez et de Nicaragua... Central American Utopia: a Panama Canal Fantasy The second work, by Athanase Airiau, published in Paris in 1860, presents a visionary perspective on canalization and colonization in Panama. The work comprises five chapters and includes detailed maps and plans, aiming to support the feasibility and benefits of constructing an interoceanic canal to shorten sea journeys between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans more than 50 years before the eventual completion of the Panama Canal in 1914. The maps are noteworthy for their somewhat fantastical, fractal-like urban geography, bringing to mind similar geometrically complex colonial plans from previous centuries, such as Sir Robert Montgomery's 1717 plan for the Margravate of Azilia. Airiau aimed his proposal at the authorities of the Granadine Confederation, present-day Colombia. His vision was centered around the canalization and colonization of the Isthmus of Panama. Airiau's ambitious plan included founding 150 farms and a city to be populated by European settlers, who would engage in agricultural activities as well as contribute to the construction and maintenance of the proposed canal. The project envisioned by Airiau was not merely an infrastructural endeavor but also a utopian plan for colonization, featuring pre-defined sections for diverse crops such as vanilla, nopal, indigo, tobacco, cereals, cocoa, cotton, vineyards, sugar, sorghum, fruits, and vegetables, along with various types of livestock. Many of the maps here are dedicated to notable political figures of the time, including Pedro Alcántara Herrán and Mariano Ospina Pérez. Airiau published this work during a period of significant interest in and debate over the potential construction of a canal that would connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and thereby revolutionize global trade routes and maritime navigation. The text underscores the urgency of establishing such a canal, as recognized by the European community, reflecting the geopolitical and economic ambitions of the time. Airiau's advocacy for the Darien route over others is grounded in a comprehensive analysis of the region's geography, climate, and natural resources, positing it as the most favorable location for the canal's construction and for the establishment of a European colony. The narrative elaborates on the envisioned benefits of this dual project, which includes the creation of a maritime and commercial city, envisaging the canal not only as a feat of engineering but also as a catalyst for agricultural and industrial colonization. The city plans are notable, both for showing important urban characteristics and for their unusual shape. The Industrial City has quays and neighborhoods split between France, Russia, Great Britain, Austria, Spain, the Netherlands, Prussia, and the United States. The Agricultural City has roads the zig and zag without any particular purpose beyond top-down aesthetics, with some roads changing course in the middle of open fields where a straight line would have sufficed. Had they ever been completed the cities would have been something to behold, post-Hausmann grand European urban architecture carved out of the jungles of Central America. Despite the innovative nature of Airiau's proposal, it did not come to fruition, a reality attributable to its utopian character. Nonetheless, this historical episode illustrates the early and ambitious endeavors to improve global maritime routes in the Panama region decades before the successful completion of the Panama Canal in the 20th century.

Land of Opportunity is a map that documents forty-three of the most well-documented toxic sites in the Bay Area, alongside local environmental justice protests and both federal and community-based remediation efforts. The tar-like blobs dripping down the paper are places notable for the amount of toxic material that has leaked into the soil and groundwater primarily as a result of high-tech industry, military activities, mercury mining during the gold rush era, and nuclear testing in the South Pacific during World War II. Despite its reputation for being one of the ‘greenest’ places in the United States, the Bay Area also has one of the highest concentrations of Superfund sites in the country, particularly in Silicon Valley, the techno-utopian capital of the United States. The map emphasizes community-based, grassroots organizing efforts, and shows both the kinds of poisons that have contaminated the land as well as the ways in which surrounding communities have protested the presence of these polluters and demanded their right to a clean, healthy environment. Land of Opportunity is a register of the ways in which the Bay Area has been shaped — both figuratively and literally — by dominant settler narratives of the landscape’s potential for wealth and resource extraction. But it is also more than the shadowland of settler, entrepreneurial greed, or the American imperial war machine: it’s also a place constituted and nourished by strong radical politics, care for community, and a trust in the power of local organizing. We live in a place of endless possibility — where the byproducts of greed and warmongering can be sublimated into other forms of power, and politics can be shaped in certain places by the will of the people.\" Connie Zheng, 2022 https://www.conniezheng.com"
