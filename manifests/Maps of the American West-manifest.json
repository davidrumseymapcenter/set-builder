The Map of the State of Kentucky, by Elihu Barker is a slight reduction in size from the original by Carey, but not as great a reduction as the edition of the map that appeared in Carey's American Atlas and General Atlas in 1795 (cf Wheat & Brun 641, 642). The London version of the Barker map seems to have the same information as the Philadelphia, but they are very different in engraving style with the Philadelphia copy having an \"American\" look. Clark is critical of the accuracy of Imlay's letters, which were probably written in Europe after he fled Kentucky and financial problems. See DAB for another critical view of Mr. Imlay."

The new boundaries are hand colored with white past down labels for names of states and territories. It might have been used as a school map in the west - we found it in a small town in the California gold country. This portion is dissected into 15 sections mounted on linen with silk edging, and folds down to 23x15."

This is a close copy of the original, but with much of the hachuring of mountains omitted as well as the representation of wooded areas. The boundaries of the Indian tribes are colored so that the ethnographic character of the map is emphasized. Original in the Warren Heckrotte Collection, which is source of description and notes."

The two Texas maps are from the early and late 1850 issues - the content is the same, but one has the C.S. Williams imprint, the other Thomas, Cowperthwait. The California maps are from the early and late 1850 editions. It is not clear why two issues of these maps were included, but there is no doubt that they were originally bound in, not added later. The remainder of the atlas is similar to our early 1850 edition. Five other maps have been pasted in by an owner: Smith's Topographical Map of Virginia and Maryland (circa 1861), Root, Anthony & Co.'s Map of the Seat of War in Italy, Mandeville's Carte En Relief Du Theatre De La Guerre En Italie, and two Harper's Weekly maps of the Seat of War in Europe.

              "value": "Hand colored manuscript map of two heavy slides of earth that obstructed the tracks of the Central Pacific Railway near Alta California. From historical records it appears that the map may detail two slides that occurred along the railroad. The largest slide occurred in the Spring of 1866 during construction of the railroad and is shown in the center of the map with damages and repairs to the various ditches that ran through the area. The April 21, 1866 edition of the Dutch Flat Enquirer mentions \"LAND SLIDE.—A huge land slide occurred a few days since near Buckley's ranch, just above this place, on the line of the C. P. Railroad, damaging the ditches of the Dutch Flat Water Company to the amount of several thousand dollars, and rendering a change of the railroad bed necessary, which will also cost an immense sum. Nearly a quarter section, extending along a heavy fill of the railroad several hundred yards, suddenly gave way and moved off in a solid body, taking with it ditches, flumes and everything else that obstructed its course, and making a change from the original survey of the railroad at that point imperative. The material that gave way, it seems, was of a soapy or pipe clay formation, and the pressure from the railroad fill is assigned as the cause.\" We estimate the map was drawn by Uren in 1880, looking back at that 1866 slide and also showing the recent 1880 slide that blocked the tracks in the upper left part of the map. The 1880 slide was recorded in the Scientific American issue Volume 42, noting that hydraulic mining techniques were used to blast away the debris covering the tracks. The map is unusual in showing illustrations of two Chinese Camps near the railroad line. With decorative compass rose, oriented with the north to upper left margin. Map showing railroad, steam engine, two views of Chinese camps, slide areas and views of Flume and water ditches. Date estimated. Uren writes his name on the map as E.C. Uren while we believe he is Charles Edward Uren."

First edition. Bound in black board with gilded title on front cover and spine. Collation: xxiii, 618 pages. Comprised of 43 maps (including 3 fold-out), as well as numerous photographic views, plans, charts and historical text. Includes a dedication, foreword, letter of transmittal, table of contents, index to figures, index to tables, statistical summary of tables, pictorial summary of photographs, glossary, appendixes and index. Comprehensive report on the Japanese American internment of World War II, in which the U.S. government forced the relocation and incarceration of Japanese Americans in detention camps in the West, ostensibly in the interests of national security. This work, created at the time of the event itself, offers a propagandist viewpoint on the internment. It attempts to justify the incarceration of Japanese Americans by posing an argument for its “military necessity” and cloaking the injustice with photographs alleging the comfort and happiness of the incarcerated individuals at the camps. In addition to these highly curated images, the volume also presents maps showing an objective picture of the history with locations of “assembly centers” and “relocation centers” [internment camps], as well as the geographic origins of the Japanese Americans held there. These maps feature the vicinity of the camps, including political boundaries, cities, railways, roads, topography, bodies of water and drainage. Some of the maps utilize data visualization to illustrate population density. Bird’s-eye photographic views depict the camps from above. Plans show typical layouts for the camps, including housing blocks, administration and police buildings, hospitals and warehouses. Charts delineate the population of interred individuals, with details on age, sex and nativity demographics. Charts also explain the transfer of individuals, as well as administrative organization and functions. All together, the volume offers a multi-faceted - while politically biased - description of the history of Japanese American internment. The Densho Encyclopedia - which covers key concepts, people, events, and organizations that played a role in the forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II - describes the work as follows, “Report issued under the name of General John L. DeWitt that provided a detailed and highly favorable account of the army's actions in removing Japanese Americans from the West Coast. The report became a key factor in the legal challenges to exclusion and resulted in both intra- and inter-departmental conflicts within the Justice and War Departments. Research in the 1980s revealed that the report had been doctored prior to the court cases, and this revelation was the basis for the reopening of the cases under the writ of error coram nobis .” https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Final_Report,_Japanese_Evacuation_from_the_West_Coast,_1942_(book)/ Provenance: Eugene Worley, as evidenced by his inscription in blue ink on front fly. Worley was a U. S. Representative from Texas who also served as a Lieutenant Commander in the United States Navy from December 1941 to August 1942, while a Member of Congress.

Her father taught her his craft at home and she later studied fine and commercial art in private lessons and at Howard University. She moved to New York to continue her education at the School of Fine Arts at Hunter College. In Harlem, Jefferson came in contact with other African-American artists and in 1935 she was a founding member of the Harlem Artists Guild, a program sponsored by the Works Progress Administration. A freelance job with the National Council of Churches’ publishing operation, Friendship Press, led to a full-time position. Jefferson eventually became the press’s art director. Jefferson was perhaps the first African-American woman to hold such a position in the publishing industry. Jefferson freelanced for major publishing houses, such as Viking and Doubleday, throughout her career. She was known as a designer of both skill and artistry."

Nakoma’s strong Anishinabe-Lakota cultural traditions are reflected in his works and writings, though the verses he composes and the values expressed are general to the ancient teachings of all tribes. With over 3,000 presentations since the 1950’s, Nakoma is an established and respected speaker, endeavoring to foster a truer understanding of the Native American and the ancient, good values of the traditional pathway. His knowledge of ancient wisdom, earth sciences and astronomy offer an audience great insight into Mother Earth, Father Sky and the meanings of the Great Circle of Life, symbolized by the Medicine Wheel."
