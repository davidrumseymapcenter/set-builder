              "value": "Nieuwe werelt anders ghenaempt West-Indien, published by Michiel Colijn in Amsterdam in 1622. Three titles, separately paginated but issued together. The titles are authored by Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas (-1625), Pedro Ordóñez de Ceballos (approximately 1545 - approximately 1630) and Jacques Le Maire (1585-1616), respectively. Bound in contemporary vellum, with early handwritten annotations, in ink, on pastedown of front cover verso. Collation: printed title-leaf, engraved title-leaf, [4], 111 pages, with fourteen engraved maps on double-sheets; second title-leaf, 3-99 pages; blank leaf; third title-leaf, engraved portrait of Le Maire on verso; seven dedication and preface leaves, 72 pages, numbered leaves 73-85, with three engraved maps (two double-sheet, one fold-out) and five engraved views. Three significant accounts of “New World” and Pacific explorations, bound together as issued. Most important is the first publication of the full journal of Jacques Le Maire’s circumnavigation, the first voyage to successfully round Cape Horn. The first part is Antonio de Herrera’s account, derived from the Spanish original, Descripcion de las Indias Occidentales, which was first published in Madrid in 1601. It was next published in Latin, French and Dutch editions, all issued in Amsterdam in 1622, using the same engravings (with some variations in the compositions of various editions). The Dutch edition of Herrera was issued with the two additional works: that of Ceballos’ account of the West Indies, and La Maire’s illustrated account of \"Terra Australis\" (Latin for \"Southern Land”). The first two parts focus on knowledge of the New World; the first part with maps of North, Central and South America and the Pacific Coast, including New Guinea and other Pacific islands, which added considerable new information of geographical knowledge of the time. In addition, the Latin title page to Herrera’s work is decorated with Castilian coat of arms, vignettes of six Aztec gods and scenes of Nova Hispania [Mexico], including a temple. The third part traces La Maire’s voyage of 1616, in search of Terra Australis, a hypothetical continent first posited in antiquity. This work represents the first true publication of the journal from the Le Maire-Schouten expedition around the world. Sailing through Le Maire Strait and rounding Patagonia via Cape Horn, this voyage had an enormous effect on future navigation, helping to end the imagined idea of a Southland. Le Maire established for the first time that New Guinea was not part of a great continent extending indefinitely to the East. This understanding altered the European perception of the archipelago, which had gone unchanged since 1545. Also, Le Maire’s voyage around Cape Horn relieved the trading monopoly of the East India Company by finding an alternative route to the East Indies that did not violate the Company Charter, which prevented other Dutch trading companies from using the existing routes of the Straits of Magellan and Cape of Good Hope. Partly inspired by Quiros and motivated by Dutch trading zeal, this was the essential precursor to Tasman’s voyage. Tasman made great use of Le Maire’s mapping of the ocean. The Le Maire voyage, the last of the 17th-century expeditions to search for the hypothetical continent from its east, was responsible for extensive discoveries in the Pacific, shown in detail on the various maps and views contained herein. Three of the views show the Eendract ship at anchor in the Solomon and Cocos Islands. The small map on the title pages of both the first and third works is the earliest published cartographic representation of California as an island, a cartographic myth that persisted until the 18th century. Herrera was the official historian to Kings Philip II, III and IV, and his Nieuwe Werelt is a precursor to his magnum opus, Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos en las Islas Terra Firme Del Mar Oceano, which eventually covered eight decades of voyages and travels published from 1601 to 1615.

This edition is distinguished by the absence of a trail line running directly from San Antonio to Austin, Texas, that appears on the third Martin edition. Compared to our seventh edition (see our # 2541), there are substantially fewer towns, roads, and physical features both in Mexico and the U.S. The two profiles in the Pacific and two inset maps in the Gulf of Mexico of the 1847 edition are not present. The covers and paste down statistics are the same as our 1847 edition. The map was printed from the same plate as the 1828 White Gallaher and White edition, evidenced by the faint copyright notice in the lower right corner under the neat line; Disturnell made many updates to the 1828 edition, and its republication by him was occasioned by the outbreak of the Mexican War. White Gallaher and White copied and slightly enlarged Henry Tanner's 1826 Map of the United States of Mexico (see our #5176). Martin lists twenty three editions of Disturnell's map. A significant difference between the Disturnell map and the earlier editions by White Gallaher and White, and Tanner, is the moving of the boundary line between Alta and Baja California about 70 miles further north toward San Diego, which was then used as the boundary in the treaty to end the Mexican War. Map is full color, folded into red cloth covers 15x10 with \"Mexico.\" stamped in gold. Relief shown by hachures and spot heights. Prime meridian: Washington."
